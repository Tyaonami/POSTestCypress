## Description
I used Ð¡ypress for the first time.  The biggest problem was with authorization in POS.  Of all the things I've tried, the only ones that worked for me were the ones I used.  But I think there should be a better way.  Since I spent a lot of time on authorization, I only wrote a couple of tests.
